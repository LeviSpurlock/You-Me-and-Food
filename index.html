        <p>I never paid attention to the waste that my meals would produce. I would go out and eat food with my friends like everyone else. Laughs were
          had and memories were made. We would go all over Nashville enjoying our favorite restaurants.<br><br>
          One thing that I often didn't think about, however, is the trash that is left behind after our meals.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="medium-6 cell">
        <p>Then one day I we went to one of our favorite spots and it hit me. I wonder how much food-based trash people
          throw away.
          Normally, I wouldn't think about this kind of thing. I would eat my food, throw away my trash, then move on
          with my day. <br><br>
          But on this day, I had noticed that the trash cans were particularly full. It was so full that the trash was
          overflowing over the tops of the cans and hitting the floor.

        <p>Thus, this project was born! I decided that it would be fruitful to bring this issue to people's mind through
          photography. Although it is not complete in my eyes, I would like
          to take you through this interesting journey so far.

          <p>At the start of this project, I didn't really know what direction I wanted to take it. I wasn't sure what
            kind of pictures to take or what places I should
            focus in on. Beyond this, I didn't have any experience in food photography. So, I decided to first begin
            with taking some typical glamor shots of food.

        <div class="medium-12 cell">
          <p>
            However, this isn't exactly what I wanted to be taking photos of. From here I started to think about the
            other places that food waste had an impact on.
            This led me to my local super market, where I had the idea to take these glamor shots of the food that was
            going to be thrown out for being on the shelves too long.

            After taking photos of the smashed cake that was soon to be thrown out, I decided that I should take some
            photos of some food that really reveals its current age.
            This quickly lead me to the fruit isle at my local grocery store.

            I hope that soon our lives will go back to normal so I can continue to work on this project and get it
            towards a more finished state. As of now, I am not completely pleased'
            with the current state of the project, but there is always time to improve! I just hope that you have
            enjoyed this little project and I hope that you come back and check in soon.<br><br>
            Thank you for your time.
